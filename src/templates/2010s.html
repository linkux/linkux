        <h3>What Happened in the 2010s - Summarizing a Decade</h3>
        <h2><a href="/" class="link_back">Back to Home Page</a></h2>
        <p>While political and social events often dominate decade summaries, I believe that the most important things that happened in the decade came from tech - The mobile revolution, the rise of social media, and the advent of effective machine learning.</p>
        <p>—— Tech and Media ——</p>
        <p><b>Cell Phones are Everywhere and Communication is Free</b></p>
        <p>We spend a huge amount of our time on our phones and we can connect to practically anyone anywhere in real time for free. That’s huge and maybe what this decade will most be remembered for.</p>
        <p><b>Machine Learning & Self-Driving Start Working</b></p>
        <p>The advent of deep neural networks has fundamentally changed what computers are capable of doing, most notably in computer vision but also in games, translation, and text analysis. Key milestones have been AlexNet (2012), AlphaGo (2015), Google Neural Machine Translation (2016) and AlphaZero (2017). Machine Learning has also allowed for the creation of the self-driving industry, which would likely have had no chance for success without the advances in computer vision. 2019 saw the first autonomous rides from Waymo in Phoenix, a historical milestone.</p>
        <p><b>Social Media and The End of Gatekeepers</b></p>
        <p>Newspapers and TV stations used to be the main form of mass entertainment and the gatekeepers in these organization effective told people what to think. Fringe opinions usually had little place to express themselves. The advent of the Internet (initially Craigslist) in the 00’s marked the end of the TV/Newspaper advertising monopoly, and the advent of social media in the 10’s marked the end of the TV/Newspaper information monopoly. The result is that the establishment of yesteryear can now be easily bypassed.</p>
        <p>Another key result is that the networks and newspapers are starving for money and competing directly with both the entertainment industry and social content, leading them to increased populism and sensationalism. This is a key reason why Trump got so much airtime in his 2015-2016 campaigns - he provoked the media into constantly covering him, something he continues to do so as president. As CBS ex-Chairman Les Moonves said about Trump - “It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS”. The only reason the New York Times and Washington Post are doing well right now is because Trump got elected.</p>
        <p>Social Media also allowed for outside-establishment movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter, which would likely not have received broad media attention in the old media regime.</p>
        <p>Another new phenomenon coming from social media is “cancel culture”, the ability of a large crowd to gang up on someone when they recognize something illicit in their past or present. Interestingly, one of the ways that people combat the social mobs is by ignoring them. That’s how Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, stayed in office after his blackface scandal. He just weathered the storm and now nobody’s talking about it, and Democrats even gained handsomely in the last Virginia state elections.</p>
        <p><b>The Death of the Cable Bundle</b></p>
        <p>Netflix and YouTube (and other streaming services) are the new TV, and the cable bundle is now more or less a sports bundle. In addition to shaping the entertainment industry this has has a big impact on the advertising industry. In the past, large consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) companies were the only ones who could afford massive advertising. Now anyone can set up a store and advertise a product through an Internet platform, leading to a Direct-to-Consumer renaissance.</p>
        <p><b>Tech Meets Real World</b></p>
        <p>Early in the decade Marc Andreessen famously said “Software is eating the world”. Software has indeed become important in many non-tech industries, and in some cases (Uber, Airbnb, DoorDash, Tesla, Scooters & e-bikes) tech companies have disrupted and taken over the physical space.</p>
        <p><b>Cloud Computing Goes Big</b></p>
        <p>The idea of using someone else’s servers was around before 2010 but the progress in Cloud services has allowed software startups to use enterprise-level cloud services with a click of a mouse, dramatically decreasing the barrier to entry in many industries. This is one reason that SaaS and enterprise software in general are flourishing.</p>
        <p><b>Tech Monopolies Emerge</b></p>
        <p>Google, Amazon, and Apple dominated in 2010, and Facebook was on the rise, but in the decade that passed each has gained a monopoly-like foothold in a massive online industry - Mobile OS, Browsers, Online Retail, Cloud Computing, Search, Maps, Social Media, Messaging. Personally I believe that the tech giants will eventually be disrupted just like previous ones have.</p>
        <p>—— Politics ——</p>
        <p><b>Aftermath of the Financial Crisis</b></p>
        <p>Seeing bankers get off the hook and “Too Big to Fail” institutions, people feel that the “game is rigged” and want to bring down the system (“Occupy Wall Street”). Not going after the bankers was possibly Obama’s biggest mistake. Even going after them and losing in the courts would have had an effect.</p>
        <p><b>Central Bankers Running the World Economy</b></p>
        <p>Central bankers have decided to pump trillions of dollars into the world economy, surprisingly not causing massive inflation. The global economy has recovered nicely but we’re in uncharted economical waters and, for instance, have no idea how interest rates can be so low without spurring inflation. We also have little to no monetary tools in case of a recession and will have to use fiscal tools instead (i.e. run a deficit).</p>
        <p><b>Populism on the Rise</b></p>
        <p>Fueled by the financial crisis, the Arab Spring refugee crisis, and the expansion of the rural-urban divide, and the increasing disparity between job qualities (manufacturing ↘️, knowledge workers ↗️), populism has seen a worldwide resurgence (e.g. Occupy Wall Street, Tea Party, Brexit, Sanders, Trump).</p>
        <p>An interesting realignment is taking place in world politics - Liberal vs Conservative is turning into Open vs Close or Cosmopolitan vs National.</p>
        <p><b>Cultural Liberalism Winning</b></p>
        <p>At least partly thanks to Hollywood, LGBT rights are becoming consensus, with practically all Western nations allowing gay marriage and increased acceptance of non-binary genders and transgenderism. Drug decriminalization is also becoming more mainstream, with legalization of marijuana and more acceptance of other drugs (LSD, mushrooms). Celebrities and cultural icons are increasingly more diverse and much more representative of Black and Latino communities.</p>
        <p>—— World ——</p>
        <p><b>Climate Change Getting Worse</b></p>
        <p>Got much worse in the past 10 years. China and India have become huge carbon contributors, the US did nothing to tackle the challenge (possibly Obama’s biggest mistake), while other countries (e.g. Canada, Sweden) enacted a carbon tax and showed how a more positive future may look like.</p>
        <p><b>“Arab Spring” Fails</b></p>
        <p>Despite the failure of the 2009 Iran protests, in 2011 people in Arab countries bravely took to the streets, starting with Tunisia. The eventual results are far divorced from initial hopes. Egypt switched to a new dictator, Libya is in tribal chaos, in Syria hundreds of thousands died, millions left the country and destabilized Europe, and the country ended up with the same dictator. Yemen is a mess, in Bahrain nothing has changed, and only Tunisia itself turned out okay.</p>
        <p><b>EU Stays Together But Weaker</b></p>
        <p>At the beginning of the decade a credit crisis loomed over the EU and it was thought that the union might not survive. Now it’s clear that the EU is here to stay but Europe is not united, some East European nations are no longer democracies (e.g. Poland, Hungary), and the UK is about to leave.</p>
        <p><b>China Becomes a Dictatorship</b></p>
        <p>After decades of party rule, China is now a dictatorship with a cult of personality around Xi Jinping. Xi has made China less open and led the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of Muslims in Xinjiang.</p>
        <p>China’s absolute control of its Internet (“The Great Firewall”) has shown that it’s possible to isolate a nation from Internet, as well as led to the creation of a strong local tech industry (e.g. Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Bytedance, Didi).</p>
        <p><b>America Withdraws, Russia Punches Above its Weight, China Expands Outward</b></p>
        <p>Russia has a relatively weak economy and little soft power but has been assertive aggressive in the past decade, often playing “Chicken” and winning against the United States, which is increasingly uninterested in policing the world. Examples include Crimea, Ukraine and Syria, as well as the meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections.</p>
        <p>China has reversed its inward-looking policy with the Belt and Road Initiative, deepening economical and political ties to nations in Asia and Africa, as well as similar policies aimed at Europe, the Middle East, and America.</p>
        <p><b>Turkey</b></p>
        <p>Erdogan has turned Turkey into a full-fledged dictatorship and is using the Syrian refugee crisis to gain influence and achieve its goals in Europe. Turkey was historically a secular country despite a large religious population, thanks to enforcement by the armed forces. Now Erdogan’s Islamist party offers religious people much more expression but ironically the cost is the decay of Turkish democracy.</p>
        <p><b>Iran</b></p>
        <p>The decade started with Iran racing towards nuclear weapons but economical pressures and threats of attack led Iran to an interim agreement in 2013 and to the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA) in 2015, sending Iran’s nuclear program at least 5 years back. At the beginning of the decade pundits and intelligence agencies were talking about a nuclear Iran in 2014-2015. Even with the unraveling of the Iran Deal, it’s very unlikely that Iran will have nuclear weapons before 2022.</p>
        <p>The crackdown on recent demonstrations shows that while the Iranian people are probably unhappy, regime change will be very difficult to achieve.</p>
        <p><b>North Korea</b></p>
        <p>North Korea has successfully set up a military deterrent against foreign meddling, both through its nuclear and missile programs and through its conventional threat against South Korea. The model of Qaddafi giving up his nuclear weapons and getting ousted may have encouraged North Korea to overtly push for nuclear deterrence of the United States.</p>
        <p><b>Israel</b></p>
        <p>The 2010s have been Benjamin Netanyahu’s (Bibi) decade, in which Israel was able to weather the Arab Spring and grow its economy in line with global economic growth, while postponing any conclusion of the conflict with the Palestinians and ignoring the demographic challenges that it presents. In the second half of the decade Netanyahu became more radicalized, got involved in several corruption schemes, incited against Israeli Arabs and “The Left”, and is now clinging to power without a parliamentary majority. It appears that many Israelis are wary of Bibi but are still conservative and unwilling to back a left-wing candidate.</p>
