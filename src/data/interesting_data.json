This is arguably already happening in China, especially considering WeChat (which Ben has talked about several times). Personally I think that ambient computing will be big and unbundle the phone, as Apple is already doing with Watch and AirPods. AR will further reinforce this trend. VR is also a wild card which could lead to a partial unbundling of the phone, albeit without replacing it.]",
